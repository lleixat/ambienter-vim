## Introduction

* Problem : I love dark colorschemes. Sometimes the ambient light or the laptop backlight makes uncomfortable reading and it's best to change the colorscheme.
* Solution : My laptop have many built-in sensors included an Ambient Light Sensor (als), so I have tryed to make the switch automatic.

This plugin purpose the manual switch between a "dark" and "light" theme, or based on the light sensor detection.

## Compatibility

Tested on GNU/Linux but should work on any _\*nix_ like system.

This plugin was fully tested and is running properly on :
 - Yoga2 Pro on Achlinux.

## Installation

Use your preferred `Pathogen|Bundle|NeoBundle|Vundle` thing.

```viml
Vundle 'lleixat/ambienter-vim'
```

Additionally you can install the colorschemes used in this doc:

```viml
Vundle 'chriskempson/base16-vim'
```

Here is an example using `Neobundle` with [chriskempson/base16-vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim) repository as dependency (optional):
```viml
NeoBundle 'lleixat/ambienter-vim', {'depends': 'chriskempson/base16-vim'}
```

## Usage

### Configuration

You have to set your custom config in your `vimrc`, just like that:

```viml
let g:ambienter_config = {
            \     "sensor": {
            \         "path": "/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/actual_brightness",
            \         "value": {"min": 200 }
            \     },
            \     "theme": {
            \         "light": {
            \             "background": "light",
            \             "colorscheme": "base16-solarized"
            \         },
            \         "dark": {
            \             "background": "dark",
            \             "colorscheme": "base16-ocean"
            \         }
            \     },
            \     "callbacks": [function("airline#load_theme")]
            \ }

```

#### Using sensor ...

I use the built-in ambient light sensor (als) on my laptop (Yoga2 Pro). Here are my `"sensor"` values:

```viml
...
\ "sensor": {
\     "path": "/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device3/in_intensity_both_raw",
\     "value": {"min": 2000}
\ },
...
```
You must define the path accordingly to your system setup.

##### ... or not

If you don't have any built-in light sensor, you can use your screen brightness:

```viml
...
\ "sensor": {
\    "path": "/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/actual_brightness",
\    "value": {"min": 200}
\ },
...
```

Basically, you can use any self updated file that contain a digit.

The `"value.min"` option define the minimum value for the switch to occur (basically from "dark" to "light").

> This value is obtained after trail and error, and probably needs some adjustments to suit everyone.

#### Theme

You have to define your own properties for `"light"` and`"dark"` theme. Usually, the `background` value must be `dark` or `light`.

```viml
...
\ "theme": {
\     "light": {
\         "background": "light",
\         "colorscheme": "base16-solarized"
\     },
\     "dark": {
\         "background": "dark",
\         "colorscheme": "base16-ocean"
\     }
\ },
...
```


> I recommend to keep the `background` and `colorscheme` definition as usual, somewhere in your vimrc:
>
> ```viml
> " Set default theme
> set background=dark
> colorscheme base16-ocean
> ```

#### Callback definition

Callbacks are fired after the theme switching and are defined in an array with the `g:ambienter_config.callbacks` var:

```viml
let g:ambienter_config.callbacks = [function("SendPlop"), function("MyAwesomeCustomFunction")]
```

Callback functions are optional and must be defined _before_ setting the "callbacks" key:

```viml
" Defining the SendPlop callback function for Ambienter
function! SendPlop()
    echom "Plop !"
endfunction

" Sending a 'plop' message after theme switching
let g:ambienter_config.callbacks = [function("SendPlop")]
```

Fom here, you can use the predefined commands as described below.

### Commands

#### Toggling between 'dark' and 'light' theme

`:Ambienter`: This command call the `Switch` function and allow toggling between your predefined `dark` and `light` theme. You can force the `dark` theme using the *bang* method.

```
:Ambienter
:Ambienter!
```

#### Change the current theme

`:AmbienterSet <ambient>`: Switch to the ambient passed in parameter. The `<ambient>` parameter could be `dark`, `light` or `hellokittyambient` if you have setted the `g:ambienter_config.theme.hellokittyambient` value...

```
:AmbienterSet dark
:AmbienterSet hellokittyambient
```

#### Theme switching based on sensor value

Manually:

```
:AmbienterSensor
```

Automagically (ie: on `BufEnter` and `WinEnter` event):

```viml
au WinEnter,BufEnter * call Ambienter.Sensor() " Adapt colorscheme to ambient light
```

Enjoy !

## Troubleshooting

#### Debuging

A small debug mode is available with:

```
let g:ambienter_config.debug = 1
```

#### Airline

Airline won't refresh properly on `au BufEnter * ...` event.
Try to set this callback in `g:ambienter_config`:

```vim
let g:ambienter_config.callbacks = [function("airline#load_theme")]
```
